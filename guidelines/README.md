# Guidelines for Data Contributors
The API serves two types of data:

- raster data in Cloud Optimized GeotTIFF (COG) format. This is primarily used to show layers on a map.
- time-series indicator data by geographic area. This is mostly used to show evolution over time in graphs.

See the [api usage](./api-usage.md) docyment for an overview on how to explore datasets and directly access source data through the API. 

See the [data usage](./data-usage.md) document for an overview of how the data may be displayed.

These guidelines are written for contributors of data, and contain information on the input formats and delivery mechanisms:

* [contributing raster data](raster.md)
* [contributing indicator data](indicators.md)
